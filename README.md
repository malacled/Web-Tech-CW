This is a site for BookCafe, a caf√© located in Tashkent. Although BookCafe itself does not have a site, we tried our best to replicate other book cafes around the world. 
There were many random google searches made throughout the making of this site, but the creator did use some old code from her previous work, specifically for the Books page beginning. Below is the link to the GitHub repository where her previous site and work is stored:

The site is very simple, it utilizes many aspects of what we learned in class including, but not limited to, the DOM, HTML5 tags (all the pages follow a header, main, footer format), CSS styles and etc. The site has a lot of visual aspects, parallax scrolling, and has easy navigation from one page to the next.

For improvement, in the future the pages could be elaborated on and the CSS could be a lot cleaner. Had we been allowed to use SCSS or JavaScript libraries, the interactiveness could be a lot better with less effort. If we were to continue this project, we would try to incorporate more usability for BookCafe, such as mobile ordering or reserving tables for certain amounts of people.
